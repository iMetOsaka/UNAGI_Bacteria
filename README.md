# General
This pipeline is for bacterial transcriptomes. It takes raw reads of ONT direct RNA sequencing (or stranded long reads) along with the genome reference and map the full features of the trasncriptome. This included trasncription start and termination sites, operon maps, reconstructed trasncriptome with focus on anti-sense and intergenic RNA.
